# ClimData

This repository is composed of statistical analysis techniques for climate data, along with Jupyter notebooks which provide examples of how the Python scripts can be used. All of the code is primarily dependent on numpy, scipy, matplotlib and cartopy and all of the datasets are available on NOAA's website:
